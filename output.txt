Yes, the Earth is round, but it's not a perfect sphere. It's actually an oblate spheroid, meaning it's slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator due to its rotation. This shape is caused by the centrifugal force that results from the Earth's spin. The idea that the Earth is round has been confirmed through various observations, including satellite imagery, photos from space, and the way ships disappear hull-first over the horizon.
